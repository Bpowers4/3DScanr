# 3DScanr
This project uses ARKit to detect feature points on surfaces. These points can then be used to reconstruct a 3D surface. 

To try it out, clone the repository and open the iOS project in XCode. Then run the app on an ARKit compatible device. After capturing a satisfactory point cloud, click Upload to upload a text file of the point cloud to the device-associated Google Drive Account. Then import this point cloud to software such as MeshLab to reconstruct a surface.
