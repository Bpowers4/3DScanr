# Contributing to 3DScanR

Want to further the capabilities of 3D scanning on mobile devices? Awesome! Open a pull request.

* If you wish to fix a bug or add a new feature, please open an issue first so that work is not duplicated.
* Before submitting a PR, make sure all tests pass. Oh wait, there aren't tests yet :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Feel free to add some though.
* 3DScanR is seriously lacking documentation. This is also a great place to start contributing.
